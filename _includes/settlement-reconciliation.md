## Settlement and Reconciliation

{% include jumbotron.html body="Reconciliation is an important step in an
economic transaction. When a payment is reconciled,  captured amounts for the
payment are matched against the corresponding settlement." %}

The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and
transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay.

*   By default, the settlement files will be sent to you by via e-mail.
*   We also have the option to send it via SFTP as well, if this is something you
    would like then you need to state this to your sales representative, so they
    can inform the setup team when the time is ready.
*   The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive it
    (per default) once a month, or once a week.
*   You do not need to subscribe, the files will be delivered by default.

### Settlement

There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement
process for you, or you handle the process yourself :

#### Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process

Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (_called
“Redovisningsservice”_). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly.

##### Swedbank Pay Checkout

When choosing [Swedbank Pay Checkout][payex-checkout] we always handle the
settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place.
Straighforward and time efficient.

#### You handle the settlement process yourself

If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an
invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions
lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you.

#### Balance Report

The Balance Report (a _.pdf file_) specifies the total sales for a specific
period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment
summary and specifications for sales and for fees.

##### Payment Summary

Provides a summary of the `Amount` sold, `Fees` and `VAT`. **If Swedbank Pay
handles the settlement process**, the `Transfered``amount` - shown in the
balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement
(the remaining total amount after fees).

##### Sales specification

Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is
specified per payment area (`CreditCard`, `Invoice`) and
underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and
Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble **if Swedbank Pay handles the
Settlement process**.

##### Fees specification

Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is
specified per payment area (`CreditCard`, `Invoice`) and
underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify `Quantity` (sales),
`Amount` (sales), `Unit price`, `Provision` and `fee Amount`. **If you handle
the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees**.

#### Transactions List

The Transaction List (provided in `.xlsx` and `.xml` formats) specifies all
transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped
by payment instrument. Both formats contain the same information, but the xml
file is meant for computer processing while the excel workbook is meant for
human interaction.

The first row contains the name of the Swedbank Pay company (e.g. Swedbank Pay
Solutions AB) that the merchant has the contract with, and the balance report
number. The header fields contain a summary of the transactions displayed in the
body.

### Reconciliation

To do the reconciliation, you need to match the information in your system
against the information provided by Swedbank Pay in the balance report and
transaction list. Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay

    activate Merchant
    activate SwedbankPay
    Merchant-->>SwedbankPay: Online payment transactions
    deactivate Merchant

    deactivate SwedbankPay

    activate Merchant

    SwedbankPay->>Merchant: Balance Report (PDF-file)
    note left of Merchant: files are sent by e-mail or file transfer
    SwedbankPay->>Merchant: Transaction list (XLSX-file)
    SwedbankPay->>Merchant: Transaction list (XML-file)
    deactivate Merchant
```

**There are two ways** for you to match the information from your system with
the information given in the reconciliation files from Swedbank Pay:

1.  You can use information **generated by your** system (you will have to set a
    unique payeeReference when you make the transaction), or
2.  You can use the transaction number **generated by Swedbank Pay** (this is called
    transaction number and is returned from Swedbank Pay after you have created
    the transaction).

A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal.
In the input data for making a capture, you will set the `payeeReference`. The
unique value of this field is the same as the field called `OrderID` in the
reconciliation file.

```js
{
    "transaction": {
        "amount": 1500,
        "vatAmount": 0,
        "description": "Test Reversal",
        "payeeReference": "ABC123"
    }
}
```

When you receive the response from Swedbank Pay, the response will include
`transaction.number`. This is the same as the field called `TransactionNo` in
the reconciliation file.

```js
{
    "payment": "/psp/{{ api_resource }}/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}",
    "capture": {
        "id": "/psp/{{ api_resource }}/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/captures/{{ page.transaction_id }}",
        "transaction": {
            "id": "/psp/{{ api_resource }}/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/transactions/{{ page.transaction_id }}",
            "created": "2016-09-14T01:01:01.01Z",
            "updated": "2016-09-14T01:01:01.03Z",
            "type": "Capture",
            "state": "Initialized",
            "number": 1234567890,
            "amount": 1500,
            "vatAmount": 250,
            "description": "Test Capture",
            "payeeReference": "ABC123",
            "failedReason": "",
            "isOperational": false,
            "operations": []
        }
    }
}
```

*   `payeeReference` sent to Swedbank Pay is equal to `OrderId` in the
    reconciliation file.
*   `capture.transaction.number` returned from Swedbank Pay is equal to
    `TransactionNo` in reconciliation file.

### Samples

The content of the files depends on the type of agreement you have made with
Swedbank Pay. For some payment instruments, only option A is available, while for other
payment instruments, only option B is available. The sample files can be
downloaded below.

#### Option A: Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process

*   **[PDF Balance Report for Swedbank Pay Checkout][attachement-1]**
*   [PDF Balance Report][attachement-2]
*   [XLSX Transaction List][attachement-3]
*   [XML Transaction List][attachement-4]

#### Option B: You will handle the settlement process yourself

*   [PDF Balance Report][attachement-5]
*   [XLSX Transaction List][attachement-6]
*   [XML Transaction List][attachement-7]

### Split Settlement

The prefix split is the easy way of doing settlements for companies with
multiple sub merchants. With only a few easy steps, you can make the settlement
process more efficient with regards to invoicing, payouts and setup for both
your sub merchants and yourself.

In short, it is a settlement feature where a company with a website or an app
can attach specific prefix numbers to sub merchants selling their goods or
services through the company. The prefix number is used to match the
transactions and the merchant, so the settlement is automatically split between
the sub merchants. If you run a site selling tickets to concerts, theatres,
sporting events etc., each venue gets its own prefix number. If you run a
funeral home, the sub merchants can be everything from flower delivery to
charities.

#### What we need from you as a company

*   Send us a KYC form for each sub merchant you want to include.
    We will also do a KYC check on your sub merchants, providing extra security
    for you.
*   Give every sub merchant who sells goods/services at your website or in your
    app a unique prefix number. This needs to be included in the KYC form you
    send to us.
    We recommend using the same customer number they have in your system.
*   Attach the prefix number to all the goods/services the sub merchant
    sells through your website or app, so the goods/services can be matched
    to the correct merchant in our back office system.
*   A partner agreement is needed for the automatic deduction of revenue cuts
    and fees.

#### How it works

1.  We set up the sub merchant prefix in our systems.
2.  The prefix number is added in the subsite field in the API call when you
    create the payment for the goods or service.
3.  The customer selects payment instrument and completes the payment.
4.  The payment goes into the client funds account.
5.  Swedbank Pay matches the transaction and the merchant using the prefix
    number.
6.  The settlement is split and connected to the correct merchant.
7.  Revenue cuts for the super merchant and fees from Swedbank Pay are deducted
    automatically.
8.  Payout to the sub merchant is done.

#### The upsides

*   Since the sub merchants are connected to Swedbank Pay through the super
    merchant instead of having separate setups, this means that you:
*   Only need one agreement for credit card, Vipps, Swish,
    MobilePay, invoice and payment gateway.
*   Only need one acquiring agreement.
*   Only need one Vipps/Swish certificate.
*   Can add more payment instruments easily, as it only has to be done once.
*   Can set up new sub merchants quickly, as the only thing needed is a KYC
    form and a prefix number. This shortens the setup time for both you and us
    to a matter of hours.
*   The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts
    minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to
    invoice your sub merchants.
*   The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our
    eCom platform.

#### Good to know

With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin
system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform
these operations.

##### Captures and cancels

Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other
normal flow.

##### Reversals

In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super
merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If
the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The
super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant.
