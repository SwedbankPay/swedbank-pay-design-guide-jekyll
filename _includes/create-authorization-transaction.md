### Create authorization transaction

The `direct-authorization` operation creates an authorization transaction
directly whilst the `redirect-authorization` operation redirects the consumer to
a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page, where the payment is authorized by the
consumer.

body="In order to use the `direct-authorization` operation, you need to collect
card data on your website, which means it must be [PCI-DSS
Compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)." %}
