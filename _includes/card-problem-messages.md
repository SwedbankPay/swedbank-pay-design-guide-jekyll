## Problems

When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a
problem message. We generally use the problem message `type` and `status` code
to identify the nature of the problem. The problem `name` and `description` will
often help narrow down the specifics of the problem.

### Contractual Problem Types

All contract types will have the following URI in front of type:
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/creditcard/<error-type>`
