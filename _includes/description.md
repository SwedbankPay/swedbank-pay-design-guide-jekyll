## Description

The `description` field is a 40 character length textual summary of the
purchase. It is needed to specify what payer is actually purchasing. Below you
will find an abbreviated Card Payments `Purchase` request.

As you can see the `description` field is set to be `test purchase -
orderNumber28749347` in the the code example. The images below will show you the
payment UI for the Redirect and Seamless View scenario.

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" body="Notice that for Redirect,
the description will be shown as `test purchase - orderNumber28749347`, as set
in the code example. For the Seamless View scenario, the description is not
shown in the payment window, but it is still required in the initial request."
