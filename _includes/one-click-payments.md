## One-Click Payments

{% include jumbotron.html body="One-Click Payments utilize a previously
generated payment token to prefill payment details for credit card or
invoice payments pages - which means that the payer don't need to enter
these details for every purchase." %}

### Introduction

For [credit card][card] and [financing invoice][invoice] payments the
payment flow and implementation varies from your default only being the
use of a `paymentToken`.
The details in this section describe explicitly the parameters that must
be set to enable one-click purchases.

### Payment Url

{% include payment-url.md
when="at the 3-D Secure verification for credit card payments" full_reference=true %}

### API Requests To Generate paymentToken

When making the initial purchase request, you need to generate a `paymentToken`.
You can do this either by by setting the `generatePaymentToken` field to
`true` (see example below) when doing a card purchase, or set the initial
operation to [`Verify`][verify].

{:.code-header}
**`generatePaymentToken` field**

```js
{
    "generatePaymentToken": true
}
```

### Finding paymentToken value

When the initial purchase is followed through, a `paymentToken` will linked to
the payment.  You can return the value by making a `GET` request towards payment
resource (expanding either the authorizations or verifications sub-resource),
after the consumer successfully has completed the purchase. The two examples are
provided below.

{:.code-header}
**Request Towards Authorizations Resource**

```http
GET /psp/creditcard/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/authorizations HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

{:.code-header}
**Request Towards Verifications Resource**

```http
GET /psp/creditcard/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/verifications HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

You need to store the `paymentToken` from the response in your system and keep
track of the corresponding consumer-ID in your system.

### Returning Purchases

When a known consumer (where you have attained a consumer-ID or similar) returns
to your system, you can use the payment token, using already stored payment
data, to initiate one-click payments. You will need to make a standard
purchase, following the sequence as specified in the Redirect or Seamless View
scenarios for [credit card][card] and [financing invoice][invoice]. When making
the first `POST` request you insert the `paymentToken` field. This must be
the `paymentToken` you received in the initial purchase, where you specified the
`generatePaymentToken` to `true`.

See the Other Feature sections for how to create a [card][create-card-payment]
and [invoice][create-invoice-payment] payment.

### Delete payment token

If you, for any reason, need to delete a `paymentToken`
you use the `Delete payment token` request.

                      body="Please note that this call does not erase the card
  number stored at Swedbank Pay.
  A card number is automatically deleted six months after a successful
  `Deletepayment token` request.
  If you want card information removed at an earlier date, you need to contact
  [ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.dk](mailto:ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.dk),
  [verkkokauppa.setup@swedbankpay.fi](mailto:verkkokauppa.setup@swedbankpay.fi),
