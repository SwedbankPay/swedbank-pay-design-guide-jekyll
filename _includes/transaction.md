The `transaction` resource contains the generic details of a transaction on a
specific payment.

When a transaction is created it will have one of three states:

*   `Initialized` - if there is some error where the source is undeterminable
    (network failure, etc), the transaction will remain Initialized. The
    corresponding state of the payment order will in this case be set to
    pending.
    No further transactions can be created.
*   `Completed` - if everything went ok the transaction will follow through to
    completion.
*   `Failed` - if the transaction has failed (i.e. a denial from the acquiring
    bank) it is possible to retry (i.e the consumer tries using another credit
    card) up to a maximum amount of retries (in that case which the payment
    order gets the state `failed` as well).
