## Create Payment

Within the card payments part of the eCommerce API, you can create four kinds
of payments ([purchase][purchase], [recurrence][recurrence], [payout][payout]
and [verification][verify]) and you can inspect and alter the details of the
individual transactions within the payment.

To create a card payment, you perform an HTTP `POST` against the `payments`
resource.

There are four different kinds of payment that can be created. These are
identified with the value of the `operation` field. Each kind are documented
in their own section below.
