## Payout

> "Payout to Card" is an add-on service that enable you to deposit winnings
> directly to your end-users' credit cards. This without  the need to collect
> card details from the end-user a second time.

### Introduction

*   Acquirer for this service is Swedbank. You require a separate Swedbank
    acquiring number to ensure that payout transactions and regular card
    transactions are kept separate.
*   You need to have the 3-D Secure protocol enabled.
*   The service is available through a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page.
*   The current implementation is only available for gaming transactions (
    [MCC][mcc]: 7995).
*   The payout service is not a part of Swedbank Pay Settlement Service.

### API requests

The API requests are displayed in the [payout flow](#payout-flow).  You create
a payout by performing a `POST` creditcard payments with key `operation` set to
