## Verify

The `Verify` operation lets you post verification payments, which are used to
confirm validity of card information without reserving or charging any amount.

### Introduction to Verify

This option is commonly used when initiating a subsequent
[One-click card payment][one-click-payments] or a
[recurring card payment][recurrence] flow - where you do not want
to charge the consumer right away.

Please note that all boolean credit card attributes involving rejection of
certain card types are optional and requires enabling on the contract with
Swedbank Pay." %}

### Verification through Swedbank Pay Payments

*   When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer initiates a
    verification operation, you make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
    your Verify information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
    `paymentID`. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a
    JavaScript source in response.
*   You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer's browser to that specified URL,
    or embed the script source on your site to create a
    [Hosted View][hosted-view] in an `iframe`; so that the payer can enter the
    credit card details in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment.
*   Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required.
*   Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - or display directly in
    the `iframe` - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment
    session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand.
    Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion,
    in contrast to a cancelled payment.
*   When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a
    `GET` request to receive the state of the transaction.
*   Finally you will make a `GET` request towards Swedbank Pay with the
    `paymentID` received in the first step, which will return the payment result
    and a `paymentToken` that can be used for subsequent [One-Click
    Payments][one-click-payments] and [recurring server-to-server based
    payments][recurrence].

### Screenshots

You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect
the credit card information.

### API Requests

The API requests are displayed in the [Verification flow]. The options you can
choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Value Verify are
listed below.

Please note that not including `paymentUrl` in the request will generate a
`redirect-verification` operation in the response, meant to be used in the
Redirect flow. Adding `paymentUrl` input will generate the response meant for
Seamless View, which does not include the `redirect-verification`. The request
below is the Redirect option.

### Verification flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to Swedbank
Pay to make a purchase. The links will take you directly to the API description
for the specific request. The diagram also shows in high level, the sequence of
the process of a complete purchase.
When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the
cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a
credit card payment:

*   3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank
    Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the
    issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no
    authentication of the cardholder is done.
*   Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank
    Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is
    decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile
    BankID.
