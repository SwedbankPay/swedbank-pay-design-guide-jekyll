This is the option where Swedbank Pay does it all. Verifying your consumer,
collecting billing and shipping addresses, storing consumer information and
providing you with the full range of available payment methods.

The only way of integrating our **Starter** implementation is **Seamless
View**.

With **Seamless View**, the payer stays at your site, and you initiate the
Swedbank Pay authentication and purchase module in an iframe. The checkin and
purchase component will be styled by Swedbank Pay.

This product supports Danish `da-DK`, English (US) `en-US`, Finnish `fi-FI`,
Norwegian `nb-NO`, and Swedish `sv-SE`.
