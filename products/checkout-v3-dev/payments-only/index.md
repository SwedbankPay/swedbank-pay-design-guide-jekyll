## Step 1: Sign Up For A Test Account

A test account gives you access to our unified dashboard for managing your
account across different platforms. We call this dashboard the Ecom Admin.

Your test account request should be sent to:
[testaccount@swedbankpay.com](mailto:testaccount@swedbankpay.com) in order to
create an account for you, we need some specific information from your side:

*   **Company name:** Your company name.

*   **Services you prefer:** Full Checkout (Starter / Business / Enterprise) or Payments Only (Payments).

*   **Email address:** To a developer or the CTO.

## Step 2: Wait For Response

Within 8 working hours we will have created your account and sent you an email
containing the following information:

**Merchant name:** This represents your core business entity with us.

**Payer ID:** This is how we identify you.

**Services:** The services that are activated and ready for testing.

**Login credentials:** You will receive a temporary password in a separate
email.

## Step 3: Get Your Access Tokens

To submit payments to us, you will be making API requests that are authenticated
with an access token.

How to generate your access token:

**Log in to:** https://admin.externalintegration.payex.com/psp/beta/login/ - For
testing environment.

**Merchant details:** Here you will find information about your
account.

An access token is necessary since it will be used together with Payee ID to
validate transactions. The Payee ID will serve as the door and, your token is
the key.

*   Navigate to “Access Tokens” at the top of the page.

*   Choose "Add" and name the token. We suggest you name it according to what
  environment it is created in.

*   Your token will only be fully visible upon creation. For security purposes,
    we will mask it as shown in the example above. If you need to keep track
    of it, please save it externally in a safe place as it will remain
    encrypted.
