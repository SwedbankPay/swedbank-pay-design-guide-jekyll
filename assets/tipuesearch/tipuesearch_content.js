One-phase payments like Swish are settled directly without the option to capture or cancel. For a full list of the available operations, see the. Operation Description create-paymentorder-capture The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. create-paymentorder-cancel Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount. create-paymentorder-reversal Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed. To identify the operations that are available we need to do a GET request against the URI of paymentorder.id: Request 1 2 GET /psp/paymentorders/ HTTP/1.1 Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; The (abbreviated) response containing an updateorder, capture, cancellation, and reversal operation should look similar to the response below: Response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json { \"paymentOrder\": { \"id\": \"/psp/paymentorders/\" }, \"operations\": [ { \"method\": \"PATCH\", \"href\": \"/psp/paymentorders/\", \"rel\": \"update-paymentorder-updateorder\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\" }, { \"method\": \"POST\", \"href\": \"/psp/paymentorders//captures\", \"rel\": \"create-paymentorder-capture\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\" }, { \"method\": \"POST\", \"href\": \"/psp/paymentorders//cancellations\", \"rel\": \"create-paymentorder-cancel\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\" }, { \"method\": \"POST\", \"href\": \"/psp/paymentorders//reversals\", \"rel\": \"create-paymentorder-reversal\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\" } ] } Field Type Description paymentorder object The payment order object. └➔ id string   operations array The array of possible operations to perform, given the state of the payment order. info Note that all of the operations Cancel, Capture and Reversal must be implemented.

Examples of one-phase payment instruments are Swish and Vipps, while payment instruments such as Credit Card are two-phase payments, requiring a Capture to be performed. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. This is done by requesting the order information from the server, to get the request link to perform the capture. With this, you can request the capture with the sum to capture, and get back the status. sequenceDiagram participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay rect rgba(81,43,43,0.1) activate Merchant note left of Payer: Capture Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: rel:create-paymentorder-capture deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;- Merchant: Capture status note right of Merchant: Capture here only if the purchased&lt;br/&gt;goods don't require shipping.&lt;br/&gt;If shipping is required, perform capture&lt;br/&gt;after the goods have shipped.&lt;br&gt;Should only be used for &lt;br&gt;PaymentInstruments that support &lt;br&gt;Authorizations. end To capture the authorized payment, we need to perform create-paymentorder-capture against the accompanying href returned in the operations list.

The redirect-consumer-identification method redirects the user to Swedbank’s own site to handle the checkin and is used in other implementations. redirect-consumer-identification should only be used in test enviroments.

This ensures that every element (like the container &lt;div&gt; elements) has loaded in before we try to access them with our script. With the scripts loading in after the entire page is loaded, we can access the &lt;div&gt; container that the Checkin will be hosted in. After that has all loaded, you should see something like this: As you can see, the payer’s information is pre-filled as provided by the initial POST.

Response The response back should look something like this (abbreviated for brevity): Response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 HTTP/1.1 201 Created Content-Type: application/json { \"paymentorder\": { \"id\": \"/psp/paymentorders/\" }, \"operations\": [ { \"href\": \"/paymentmenu/core/scripts/client/px.paymentmenu.client.js?token=&amp;culture=sv-SE\", \"rel\": \"view-paymentorder\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"contentType\": \"application/javascript\" } ] } Field Type Description paymentorder object The payment order object. └➔ id string   operations array The array of possible operations to perform, given the state of the payment order. The paymentorder object is abbreviated since it’s just the id and operations we are interested in. Store the id of the Payment Order in your system to look up status on the completed payment later. Then find the view-paymentorder operation and embed its href in a &lt;script&gt; element. That script will then load the Seamless View for the Payment Menu. We will look into how to hook that up next. info orderReference must be sent as a part of the POST request to paymentorders and must represent the order ID of the webshop or merchant website. Step 4: Display the Payment Menu To load the payment menu from the JavaScript URL obtained in the back end API response, it needs to be set as a script element’s src attribute. You can cause a page reload and do this with static HTML or you can avoid the page refresh by invoking the POST to create the payment order through Ajax and then create the script element with JavaScript, all inside the event handler for onConsumerIdentified. The HTML code will be unchanged in this example.

It should look like this, depending on whether the payer is logged in (top) or a guest user (bottom): When the consumer completes the payment, the Payment Menu script will be signaled and a full redirect to the completeUrl sent in with the Payment Order will be performed. When the completeUrl on your server is hit, you can inspect the status on the stored paymentorder.id on the server, and then perform capture. If the payment is a Sale or one-phase purchase, it will be automatically captured. A third scenario is if the goods are sent physically to the payer; then you should await capture until after the goods have been sent. You may open and close the payment menu using .open() and .close() functions. You can also invoke .refresh() to update the Payment Menu after any changes to the order. Below, you will see a complete overview of the payment menu process. Notice that there are two ways of performing the payment: Consumer perform payment out of iframe. Consumer perform payment within iframe. sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay rect rgba(138, 205, 195, 0.1) activate Payer note left of Payer: Payment Menu Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Initiate Purchase deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: POST /psp/paymentorders (paymentUrl, payer) deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel:view-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Display Payment Menu on Merchant Page activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Initiate Payment Menu Hosted View (open iframe) Payer --&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Payment UI page in iframe deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Do payment logic deactivate SwedbankPay opt Consumer perform payment out of iFrame Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Redirect to 3rd party Payer -&gt;&gt;+ 3rdParty: Redirect to 3rdPartyUrl URL deactivate Payer 3rdParty --&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Redirect back to paymentUrl (merchant) deactivate 3rdParty Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Initiate Payment Menu Hosted View (open iframe) Payer -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Payment UI page in iframe deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt; Payer: Do payment logic end SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Payer: Payment status deactivate SwedbankPay alt If payment is completed activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Event: onPaymentCompleted Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Check payment status deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET &lt;paymentorder.id&gt; deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel: paid-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay opt Get PaymentOrder Details (if paid-paymentorder operation exist) activate Payer deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET rel: paid-paymentorder deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Merchant: Payment Details deactivate SwedbankPay end end opt If payment is failed activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Event: OnPaymentFailed Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Check payment status deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET {paymentorder.id} deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel: failed-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay opt Get PaymentOrder Details (if failed-paymentorder operation exist) activate Payer deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET rel: failed-paymentorder deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Merchant: Payment Details deactivate SwedbankPay end end activate Merchant Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Show Purchase complete opt PaymentOrder Callback (if callbackUrls is set) activate Payer deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt; Merchant: POST Payment Callback end end Now that you have completed the Payment Menu integration, you can move on to finalizing the payment in the After Payment section.
