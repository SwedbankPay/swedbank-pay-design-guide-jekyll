{% include jumbotron.html body="When the consumer has **completed** the entire
[Checkin](checkin) and [Payment Menu](payment-menu), you need to implement the

operations are and how they are executed is described below." %}

## Introduction

Below is the final part of the sequence diagram illustrating how a capture
operation is performed.

    participant Merchant
    participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay

    rect rgba(81,43,43,0.1)
        activate Merchant
        note left of Payer: Capture
        Merchant ->>+ SwedbankPay: rel:create-paymentorder-capture
        deactivate Merchant
        SwedbankPay -->>- Merchant: Capture status
        note right of Merchant: Capture here only if the purchased<br/>goods don't require shipping.<br/>If shipping is required, perform capture<br/>after the goods have shipped.<br>Should only be used for <br>PaymentInstruments that support <br>Authorizations.
        end
```

## Operations

Most payment instruments are two-phase payments –
in which a successful payment order will result in an authorized transaction –
that must be followed up by a capture or cancellation transaction in a later
stage. One-phase payments like Swish are settled directly without the option to
capture or cancel. For a full list of the available operations, see the.

| Operation                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create-paymentorder-capture`  | The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. |
| `create-paymentorder-cancel`   | Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount.                                                                                         |
| `create-paymentorder-reversal` | Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed.                                                                                                                                                               |

To identify the operations that are available we need to do a `GET` request
against the URI of `paymentorder.id`:

{:.code-view-header}
**Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_order_id }} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

The (abbreviated) response containing an `updateorder`, `capture`,
`cancellation`, and `reversal` operation should look similar to the response
below:

{:.code-view-header}
**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
